# **Why Learn C ?**
 - Fewer Libraries. 
 - Embedded Programming.
 - Helps to understand the fundamentals of Computer Theories.
 - C is very fast in terms of execution time.
 - C combines the functionality of both low-level and high-level languages.

<br />

# **C LANGUAGE HISTORY:**

- The C programming language is a procedural programming language. 
- Dennis Ritchie created it as a system programming language for writing operating systems.
 - C is used to create Microsoft Windows, Apple’s OS X,and Symbian. 
 - The smart devices we use today are powered by C-programmed technology.

<br />


# **BASIC SYNTEX OF C :**
```sh
#include<stdio.h>
    int main()
    {
    return 0;
    }
```

# **WHERE CAN WE WRITE CODE ?**
- VS CODE
- TURBO C++
- CODE BLOCK
- NOTEPAD
- NOTEPAD++


<br />

# **WHY SHOULD WE USE VS CODE FOR CODING?**
- Visual Studio Code is “a free-editor that helps the programmer write code, helps in debugging and corrects the code using the intelli-sense method ”.
